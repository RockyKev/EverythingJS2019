What are Service Workers in JS?


Service Workers are a core part of Progressive Web Apps. 
They allow: 
    * Caching of Resources
    * Web Push Notifications

They are a proxy between the web app, browser, and network.

They run on a separate thread, so it's non-blocking.
    * They don't have access to the DOM & other main APIs (like cookies, XHR, or web storage)
    
   * They rely heavily on promises to wait for responses.
